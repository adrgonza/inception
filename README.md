## Introduction

Inception is a containerization platform that allows users to create and manage lightweight, isolated environments called containers. These containers encapsulate applications and their dependencies, providing a consistent and reproducible environment for software deployment and execution.

## Usage

To use Inception, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/adrgonza/inception.git
    ```

2. Build the Inception:

    ```bash
    make
    ```
    
## Features

Inception supports the following features:

- Container creation and management
- Image-based containerization
- Resource isolation and allocation
- Network and storage management
- Customizable container configurations
- CLI for interacting with the Inception daemon

## Building

To build Inception, simply run:

```bash
make
```
